# Exelentic.com Overhaul

## Dear Mr. Hachmoeller,

I am pleased to present the comprehensive overhaul of [Exelentic.com](https://www.exelentic.com), developed as part of my internship thesis for my Bachelor's degree in International Business at OTH-AW.

### Comparison of Versions

- **Original Website:** [Exelentic.com](https://www.exelentic.com)
- **Overhauled Version:** [https://renaneuzebio.github.io/website-2025/](https://renaneuzebio.github.io/website-2025/)

### Overview

This project involved a complete redesign and enhancement of the Exelentic website to improve user experience, visual appeal, and functionality. The new version features updated layouts, responsive design for various devices, and optimized performance to better showcase Exelentic's services and client portfolio.

I invite you to visit both versions and compare the improvements made in the overhaul.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project.

Best regards,  
Renan Euzebio
